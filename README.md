# 🧠 MERN Stack Bootcamp – My Brain vs Code (Day-wise Logs)

> *"Started from `<div>`, now we’re here..."*

Yo there, fellow dev or lost internet traveler 👋
This repo is where I dump my brain daily as I crawl, walk, and (eventually) run through the MERN Stack.

### ⚠️ Status Update:

Still stuck in the frontend trenches. Haven’t touched Mongo, Express, or Node yet — they're in the backlog, staring at me like:

### 🧩 Current Stack of Chaos:

* HTML & CSS – I know enough to mess up layouts confidently
* JavaScript – Where semicolons are optional and confusion is guaranteed
* React – Functional components, hooks, props, and praying to the JSX gods
* Redux – Because managing state is more complex than my emotions

### 📁 Structure:

Every folder is named like `Day 0`, `Day 1`, `Day 2`, etc.
Inside, you'll find:

* whatever I learned that day,
* mini projects, experiments, breakdowns,
* and the occasional breakdown *of myself*.

### 💡 Why This Exists:

* Accountability
* Repetition = retention
* So future-me can look back and say: *"Damn, I really used to write `const [data, setData]` for everything huh..."*

### 🛠️ Coming Soon:

Once I stop procrastinating and pretending to be productive, I’ll dive into:

* Express (hello APIs)
* Node.js (JS but backend)
* MongoDB (NoSQL, but lots of WTFs)
